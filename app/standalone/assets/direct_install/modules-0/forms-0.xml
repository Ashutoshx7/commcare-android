Automatically generated graphs of the data you **Record** will appear on the **Partograph** tab. You can scroll through the graphs or tap on each twice in order to examine the graph more closely.

These have a horizontal x-axis that represents the time in hours and a vertical y-axis as labeled. As you record the **Pulse** and **Respiration** measurements, they will appear on the graph as dots with lines connecting the subsequent measurements, as seen below.</value>

						<value>* The **Cervical Dilation/Descent of Head** graph is perhaps the most complicated graph. First and foremost, this represents two pieces of information: the dilation of the cervix (seen on the left y-axis and represented by squares) as well as the descent of the fetus' head (seen on the secondary right y-axis and represented by circles). Furthermore, there are two colored regions on the graph: yellow alert and red action. When the line tracking cervical dilation crosses into the yellow region that means that the cervix is dilating slowly and additional monitoring and necessary actions must be taken. When the line crosses into the red region that means the cervix is dilating abnormally and immediate action must be taken.</value>
