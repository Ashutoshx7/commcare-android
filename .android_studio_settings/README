Copy files in "inspection" and "codestyles" folders into the corresponding folders in your local AndroidStudio config directory (/home/{username}/.AndroidStudio).

Then select:
 - "CommCare Inspection Profile" through File -> Settings -> Project Settings / Inpsections
 - "CommCare Coding Style" through File -> Settings -> Project Settings / Coding Style

Remember to re-copy these files if they ever get updated.
